# Personal Portfolio Website

**http://www.soenke-schaarschmidt.de**

My Single Page Application Portfolio created using React for showing my Skills, Projects and Experiences.
I wanted to create a user-friendly and simple web profile for my work.

With this project I intended to learn more advanced css styling as well as the use of css-variables.
Additionally, I wanted to use transitions and scroll animations as I had not implemented these manually before. 
For the later I used the **[aos library](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/)**.
The Dark Mode Feature was a nice play with css manipulation. I also wanted to have an easily extendable language switch 
for the content of the website which I implemented using **[i18next](https://www.i18next.com/)**.
