# Personal Portfolio Website

http://www.soenke-schaarschmidt.de/soenke/build/index.html

My Single Page Application Portfolio created using React for showing my Skills, Projects and Experiences.
I wanted to create a user-friendly and simple web profile for my work.

With this project I intended to learn more advanced css styling as well as the use of css-variables.
Additionally, I wanted to use transitions and scroll animations as I had not implemented these manually before.
The Dark Mode Feature was a nice play with css manipulation.
I also wanted to have an easily extendable language switch for the content of the website which I implemented using
i18next.
